                                        <p>"I loved working with Sandro on my game. <br>
                                            I have been stuck at my level for a while and I needed a different perspective on how to improve my game. <br>
                                            Sandro helped me identify the weaknesses in my game and how to go about the thinking of each move. <br>
                                            I've been on a winning streak since. :) Thank you Sandro. <br><br>
                                            If you are on the fence about working with Sandro.... you won't be disappointed."</p>
